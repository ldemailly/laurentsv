Ok so I figured after working at Facebook I should add some ways for people
to leave comments and have discussions on my posts.

It's pretty well explained on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments

You first need to setup an app/dev account on https://developers.facebook.com/ - it's a bit confusing there on what to select... Pick an "app", turn it on, and get the id.

ps: At first I didn't notice the _You can specify either fb:app_id or fb:admins, but not both._ don't be like me, pay Attention

This being said, I still don't know why the moderation link is only showing on one of my pages and not the other... to be continued
