Ok so I figured after working at Facebook I should add some ways for people
to leave comments and have discussions on my posts.

It's pretty well explained on the [facebook comments plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments) page

You first need to setup an app/dev account on [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/) - it's a bit confusing there on what to select... Pick an "app", turn it on, and get the id.

**ps**: At first I didn't notice the "_You can specify either fb:app_id or fb:admins, but not both._" don't be like me, pay attention :)

I had problems getting the "Moderation tool" link to show up consistently (it showed on the about page but not on the first blog post), removing the `data-href=` part of the code seems to have fixed it (that or some other weird caching/change)

Speaking of caching... I'm having issue with my combo Amazon cloudfront fronting github pages... I did that setup because I wanted to use https (it's 2017 after all) and the TLS termination / certificate management seems ok on Amazon but my setup may not be great.
